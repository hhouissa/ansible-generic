## Example Playbook

This is a sample playbook file for deploying the Ansible Galaxy java role in a localhost and installing openjdk-jre.

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: diodonfrost.java
```

## Local Testing

The preferred way of locally testing the role is to use Docker. You will have to install Docker on your system.

You can also use Virtualbox with kitchen-ci to run tests locally. You will have to install Virtualbox and Vagrant on your system. For all our tests we use test-kitchen.

Next install test-kitchen:

```shell
# Install dependencies
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

### Testing with Docker

```shell
# List all tests with kitchen
kitchen list

# fast test on one machine
kitchen test default-centos-7

# test on all machines
kitchen test

# for development, create environment
kitchen create default-centos-7

# Apply ansible playbook
kitchen converge default-centos-7

# Apply inspec tests
kitchen verify default-centos-7
```

### Testing with Virtualbox

```shell
# Specify kitchen file on Linux
export KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen-vagrant.yml

# fast test on one machine
kitchen test os-packaging-freebsd-112
```
### Testing Windows and Solaris with Virtualbox

Windows and Solaris can only be test with Virtualbox provider,do not use 'kitchen test' command for testing Windows and Solaris environment. There 4 steps you will be using with test-kitchen as part of your workflow.

First of all we must set the kitchen file:
```shell
# For testing Windows
export KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen-windows.yml

# For testing Solaris
export KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen-solaris.yml
```

Provision the virtual machines, a Linux machine to run Ansible and Windows/Solaris machines to apply playbook again:
```shell
# deploy machines
kitchen create

# Launch playbook
kitchen converge
```

Finaly launch inspec tests:
```shell
kitchen verify
```

For cleaning environment use:
```shell
kitchen destroy
```
